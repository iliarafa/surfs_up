# Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to examine weather data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We will look initially in temperature data for the months of June and December, then percipitation levels for the same month as well as average measurements for both based on the weather station that provided the data.
