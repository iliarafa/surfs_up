# Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to examine weather data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We will look initially in temperature data for the months of June and December, then percipitation levels for the same month as well as average measurements for both based on the weather station that provided the data. 

# Results

- Minimum temperatures are 8 degrees lower in December compared to June.
- Maximum temperatures are 2 degress higher in June compared to December. 
- Average temperatures are 3 degrees higher in June at 75 degrees compared to 71 in December. 
- Standard deviation is 3.25 for June and 3.75 for December. 

# Summary

## Proof of a steady temperature pattern
The most important result of our analysis is the standard deviation of daily temperature range. The values for both months indicate remarkably steady temperature patterns. The mean Standard Deviation for June is well below the **mean std for summer days** which stands at 3.717 - In our case **std** for June is 3.25. Similarly std for June is also a bit lower than the **mean std for winter days** which stands at 3.807 - In our case **std** for December is 3.75.

Zooming in into the numbers we see that the variation in temperatures is indeed insignificant compared to other regions of the world. With a year-round low of around 55 degrees, highs around 85 and means slightly over 71 degrees the surf and ice-cream business is fail safe. The customers can eat ice-cream and surf all year long and will only need to dress up in the coldest nights of winter.
